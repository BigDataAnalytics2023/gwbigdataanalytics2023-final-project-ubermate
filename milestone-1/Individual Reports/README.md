# Ubermate

## Purpose 
Our project focuses on making the Uber experience effcient for drivers. We know that for some drivers this may be a side gig and
others it is their main source of income. For both, it is important that they make the most amount of money possible for each trip.
Any amount of downtime or low pay can be vary impact as it ultimately wastes time. There is a plethora of data out there documenting
trips. We want to use this data to document driver and passenger behavior to determine the most appropriate paths that drivers should 
take to give them the most amount of money. Our hope is to build a tool that can actively tell drivers which area to drive around, whether 
at the start of their trip or during downtime, so that they get that msot amount of money possible for each trip.

## Challenge
### Data Types
We believe that the data that we will be working with will have some form of structure to it. However with this, there will probably be the
issue of data storage since this type of data will have metadata, and it will be expected that we will deal with thousands of datapoints.
### Security
Becuase we will be handling the data or various Uber drivers, we have to make sure that the data we use doesn't reveal any sensitive information
about those users or the vehicles. 
### Tools
This may requre the use a multiple tools and algorithm models that we need to extensively research and understand. In addition, we need to find
ways to properly integrate them seemlessly.
### Time
We also need to develop methods that are able to quickly take in and analyze large amounts of data to make decisions within a quick enough time for
the data to be useful to user, as the driving/riding activities are actively changing.
