# Ubermate

## Purpose 
Our project focuses on making the Uber experience efficient for drivers. We know that for some drivers this may be a side gig and for
others it is their main source of income. For both, it is important that they make the most amount of money possible for each trip.
Any amount of downtime or low pay can be very detrimental as it ultimately wastes time. There is a plethora of data out there documenting
trips. We want to use this data to document driver and passenger behavior to determine the most appropriate paths that drivers should 
take to give them the most amount of money during their shift. Our hope is to build a tool that can actively tell drivers which area to drive around, whether 
at the start of their trip or during downtime, so that they get the most amount of money possible for each trip.

## Challenge
### Data Types
We believe that the data that we will be working with will have some form of structure to it. However with this, there will probably be the
issue of data storage since this type of data will have metadata, and it will be expected that we will deal with thousands of datapoints.
### Security
Becuase we will be handling the data of various Uber drivers, we have to make sure that the data we use doesn't reveal any sensitive information
about those users or their vehicles. 
### Tools
This may requre the use of multiple tools and algorithm models that we need to extensively research and understand. In addition, we need to find
ways to properly integrate them seamlessly.
### Time
We also need to develop methods that are able to quickly take in and analyze large amounts of data to make decisions within a quick enough time for
the data to be useful to user, as the driving/riding activities are actively changing.

## Potential Literatures 
These are some papers that we believe will provide us with guidance.
* Real-Time Uber Data Analysis of Popular Uber Locations in Kubernetes
Environment
* Uber Related Data Analysis using Machine Learning
* Identifying the Hotspots in Urban Areas Using Taxi GPS Trajectories
* Mining Interesting Locations and Travel Sequences from GPS Trajectories
